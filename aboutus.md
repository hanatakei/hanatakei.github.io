Ashley Conard
![Ashley Conard](https://github.com/hanatakei/hanatakei.github.io/blob/master/ashley_conard.JPG)Ashley is a PhD candidate in Computational Biology concentrating in Computer Science at Brown University, developing time course mathematical models under the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Ashley is a Fulbright Scholar who has served on two Board of Trustees for The Fulbright Association and AnitaB.org. She specializes in design algorithms utilizing bayesian inference modeling, game theory, and parallel computing. Ashley has pioneered in projects at MIT Lincoln Labs, Eli Lilly and Company, Vanderbilt University, and DePauw University. She has been very involved in STEM outreach specifically at Google, the American Chemical Society, and several schools.

Ellie Duan
I graduated from Sichuan University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Life Science and Biology (Elite Program) in 2014. I did my honors thesis as an exchange senior undergrad at the University of Connecticut, where I also earned Ph.D. degree in 2018. My Ph.D. thesis work focused on mammalian epigenetics, including trans-generational effect of maternal diets on fetal genomic imprinting, X chromosome dosage compensation and DNA methylome dynamics in pre-implantation embryos. My current research interests include investigating molecular mechanisms of X chromosome dosage compensation and how pioneer transcription factors regulate the global transcription during zygotic genome activation in Drosophila. 

Rachel Lee
I am currently a junior at Brown University concentrating in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. My current research project involves how CLAMP may be involved in regulating the heat shock response. After graduation, I plan on pursuing an MD.  

Renee Soto
Renee Seto, Undergraduate Student.  I am currently a Senior at Brown University, concentrating in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.  My previous undergraduate research involved uncovering the effects of calcineurin signaling on development in zebrafish.  My current research interests lie in the systems of molecular genetics, particularly in regulation of transcription through development.
